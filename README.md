# Accounting Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository provides implementations of various machine learning and deep learning models, including DNN, KNN, and Transformer architectures, for accounting data analysis and profit prediction.

## Dataset

Data file: 利益予測データベース_20250330.xlsx  
(The dataset should be uploaded by the user. It contains financial and accounting indicators as features, with profit as the prediction target.)

## Features

- Supports multiple ML/DL models: DNN, KNN, Transformer, etc.
- All workflows are in Jupyter Notebook format for easy use.
- Recommended to run directly on Google Colab.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Upload your data file (利益予測データベース_20250330.xlsx) to your Colab environment or workspace. 
3. Open and run the provided notebook files (such as DNN_model.ipynb, knn_model.ipynb, transformer_model.ipynb) in Google Colab.
4. You can modify or extend the code as needed for your own analysis.

## Project Objectives

- Predict profit based on real accounting and financial data.
- Compare the performance of different machine learning and deep learning models for the same prediction task.
- Provide a reproducible workflow for financial data modeling.

## Future Work

- Add more advanced models and automated feature engineering.
- Expand to other financial analysis and prediction tasks.
